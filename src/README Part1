Started and completed this part of the assingment on Feb 2. It took about 2 hours.
I consulted my TA Mack Karnuta.
I did not consult any outside resources.

CleverHangmanPart1.pdf:
page 1: adjusted guess list
page 2: original guess list
page 3: # of guesses required to solve all words

The adjusted guess list (ESIARN TOLCDU PMGHBY FVKWZX QJ) sorts letters in order of popularity based on how often they are seen in the dictionary.
The original list (ETAOIN SHRDLU CMFWYP VBGKQJ XZ) is derived from every English text. Because the list of words trying to be guessed are made
up of common, everyday words (as you would find in a dictionary), the adjusted list is more appropriate for guessing efficiently. The generally 
higher percentages on page 1 of the pdf than on page 2 confirm this assertion.
