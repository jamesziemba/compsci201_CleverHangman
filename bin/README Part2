Started this assignment on Feb. 11 and finished it on Feb. 18.
I consulted Chalena Scholl, various students and TAs at UTA hours, and my tutor George Hugh.
I consulted StackOverflow.

CleverHangmanPart2.pdf:
page 1: % of words guessed correctly
page 2: # of guesses required to solve all words
page 3: 8 letter words and number of words missed w/ 8, 9, and 10 guesses

My code should be pretty simple to follow. The first part of my code counts the number of occurrences of each letter in the
words in wordlist. It sorts this info into a HashMap (key = letter, value = number of times letter occurs). The second
part of the code iterates over the KeySet and finds the letter that occurs the most and stores it as a variable "guess."
I then use an iterator to iterate over wordlist and, depending on if "guess" is in the secret code, either remove all words
with "guess" in it (guess is wrong) or not in it (guess is right). I am confident in this code because I believe my logic is
sound. If I guess the most common letter that has not been guessed each time, I will maximize the amount of words I can get
right.
